## Define a link for reset password notification

This feature sends an email notification with a link to reset password.

To build the link, it grabs the url from `config/json-api-auth.php` where you can set the endpoint for a frontend reset form url by changing the key:

```php
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Json Api Forgot Password Configuration
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| This value is used to instruct the package the url for the notification
| This would be a page of your frontend new password form.
| Its not related to any backend route take that in mind.
|
*/

'new_password_form_url' => 'https://your-frontend-app.any/new-password',
```

This is useful because this is an API feature, so the behavior is not to redirect to a server render view, the expected behavior is that the link goes to a password reset form in a frontend application totally separated from the backend.
